# Schwab Tax Optimizer

**Schwab Tax Optimizer** is a Python tool that helps you analyze and optimize your investment-related tax outcomes using exported CSV data from your Charles Schwab brokerage account. It calculates short-term and long-term capital gains, ordinary income, disallowed losses, and provides actionable insights to help you minimize your tax burden.

---

## What It Does

* Analyzes your **realized capital gains/losses**
* Distinguishes between **short-term** and **long-term** gains
* Categorizes **ordinary income** (e.g. dividends, interest)
* Identifies **disallowed wash sale losses**
* Provides **insights and strategies** to optimize your tax position
* Supports **scenario simulations** for tax planning

---

## Exporting Data from Schwab

You need **two CSV files** from Schwab:

1. **Realized Gains Page**

   * Navigate to: `Accounts > Realized Gain/Loss`
   * Select your desired time range (e.g., year-to-date or custom)
   * Click **Export** and download the **CSV**

2. **Transaction History Page**

   * Navigate to: `Accounts > History`
   * Select a time range that **covers all relevant transactions**
   * Click **Export** and download the **CSV**

---

## How to Use

Once youâ€™ve exported your data:

1. Save both CSVs in the project directory.
2. Rename them to:

   * `realized_gains.csv`
   * `transaction_history.csv`
3. Run the tax optimizer:

```bash
python realized_gains.py --months 6
```
